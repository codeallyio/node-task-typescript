# Template for Node Tasks with TypeScript

## TODO

Your task is to implement two middleware functions for the Node service written in TypeScript.

1. `notFoundMiddleware` ➜ middleware used when no other endpoint matches

2. `catchErrorMiddleware` ➜ middleware used when some other sends `next(error)`

## Available Scripts

`npm run build` ➜ building the application

`npm start` ➜ build & run the application

`npm run dev` ➜ run the application without building

`npm test` ➜ running Mocha-x-Chai tests


### Good Luck!
